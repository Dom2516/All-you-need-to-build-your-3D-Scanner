  MAJOR AND GREAT UPDATE!
  Note, that the device will restart twice
  - added: OpenScanCloud - it is now possible to use the cloud processing capabilities and
    send your image set to the OpenScanCloud for reconstructing your 3d model
    This is totally free/donation-based and the only thing needed is a one-time-registration,
    which can be done through the user interface (settings)
    
  - added: help texts
  - added: warning if used disk space is > 80%
    
  - improved: increased the framerate of the preview window
  - improved: preview is in full-resolution, when cropx/y is larger then 40, which should help
    setting the focus
    
  - removed: dev mode, as there has not been any improvements in over a year...
