# OpenScan - Photogrammetry Torture Test

## Overview:

For a very long time, i wanted to publish several  image sets containing various challenging features. I will host the image sets and resulting meshes on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17gwZCjs7iHAg9MYrOH1vxBhsXcBB6EWp?usp=sharing)
This is a public project, so you can use the files as you wish. I would love to see more people contributing and giving the image set a run on there photogrammetry pipeline + sharing the result.
If you know a better hosting solution, please let me know.
